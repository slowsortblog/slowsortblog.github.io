This blog is called slowsort in reference to the reluctant sorting algorithm. The choice of the name was partially born out of procrastination chatter with fellow researchers near the coffee machine. Indeed, there are moments in academic work when you progress slowly towards the stated goal, even though you may have little enthusiasm for getting there. Partially this name is inspired by a computer science meme that blockchain is just a very inefficient database. But probably the main reason for the title is the fact that, just like a reluctant algorithm, this blog has no ambitions to address the complexity of blockchain research in any resemblance of efficient manner. Rather this blog is going to identify some (very random) problems in this field and multiply subproblems and subsubproblems in the recursive fashion for as long as possible [1]. The reader might also wonder why this blog has ‘philosophy’ in its title. This is to signal that the reader should not expect to find any meaningful explanations or clear answers in this blog but rather unnecessarily obscure takes on seemingly obvious questions, as often happens with the readers of philosophical texts. Finally, the blog should not be considered a critique of blockchain technology. The authors of this blog empathetically reject concern troll questions: ‘what problem does blockchain solve?’. They do not care if it does. Like many others in the blockchain space, the authors of this blog simply enjoy writing stuff (whether text or code) and putting it online because they can.
