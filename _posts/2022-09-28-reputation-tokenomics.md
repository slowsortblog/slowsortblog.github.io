**TLDR; Key points**:

- Reputation-based tokenomics are promising alternatives to naive tokenomics  
- Reputation does not require a strong, persistent identity
- Obsession with Sybil resistance obscures that often Sybil tolerance is good enough 


## The new kid in town: reputation-based tokenomics 

Reputation has been getting a lot of interest in the blockchain space recently. We do not mean the reputation of crypto-influencers and project founders who dump their bags on unsuspecting community members (although undeniably fascinating topic), but reputation as proper research and engineering direction. There is certainly a lot of experimentation with different conceptual and practical reputation solutions: non-transferable tokens as a form of reputation (Soulbound tokens), DAO toolboxes for the evaluation of members‚Äô contributions (Sourcecred, Coordinape), reputation to penalize censorship and other misbehavior (relays in MEV-boost), and many more in the development. 

This increase in interest is also mixed with other assumptions and problems which pop up in discussions on reputation in the blockchain context. The first one is the topic of identity, including various kinds of identity management solutions. The second prominent topic is a persistent concern regarding ‚ÄòSybils.‚Äô There is also a good chance that you have read or heard more than once that: we need an ‚Äòidentity layer‚Äô in blockchains to solve the ‚Äòproblem of Sybils.‚Äô These are interesting questions, and even more intriguing is to consider if all these things are parts of the same big problem. It might be helpful to try and untangle reputation from the surrounding issue first.

So why this resurgence of interest in reputation mechanisms now? Probably, one of the strongest motivating factors at the moment is a growing collective realization that we have run into a hard wall of limitations for naive tokenomics. No matter how complicated the design of the token distribution mechanism is, as long as we limit the design toolbox to monetary incentives, there are always the same problems.

For one, decentralized governance based on freely tradable tokens inevitably oscillates between plutocracy and ochlocracy. Or, in blockchain terms, ‚Äòüêã whale economy‚Äô and ‚Äòü¶ê shrimp economy.‚Äô This means that either we have to contend with a few Whales (large token holders) dictating their will or rely on the wisdom of a crowd of smaller token holders, who are often unfortunately too easily impressionable ([Wonderland story](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/01/wonderland-founder-im-here-to-fix-this-and-make-it-all-back/)).

But generally speaking, the limitation of monetary incentive mechanisms stems from the fact that they do not allow for the easy alignment of incentives. Mercenary capital does not care for the survival and sustainability of the project but only for its own survival. And yes, the greed of the markets can do wonders, but it can also easily backfire, as it keeps reliably happening with algorithmic stablecoins. Finding people who would like to contribute because they share the goals of the project and finding a way to acknowledge the merits of their contributions arguably is a more sustainable approach for collaboration in the long term. 

Against this background, reputation has an intuitive appeal of different social mechanics that are not based on simple profit-seeking. Something that can capture those kinds of participation that are based on merits and fairness. Something that we associate with cooperation, peer recognition, and social capital. Reputation, in that sense, could be considered a different type of incentive mechanism, attracting and rewarding with social recognition those who do care about specific goals and values of the project. It may seem a bit utopian, but we have some good examples of open-software projects working this way, early Wikipedia, early Linux, and even early Bitcoin.
